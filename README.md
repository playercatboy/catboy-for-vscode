# Catboy for Visual Studio Code

A Visual Studio Code extension that provides build system integration for the Catboy C build system.

## Features

- **Project Discovery**: Automatically discovers Catboy projects in your workspace by scanning for `build.yaml` files
- **YAML Pre-processor (YPP) Support**: Full integration with Catboy's YPP module for split YAML configurations using `$include` directives
- **Interactive CodeLens for $include**: Clickable links above include directives with full internationalization support
- **Tree View Interface**: Displays all projects and their targets in a hierarchical tree view
- **Enhanced Navigation**: Go-to-file functionality navigates to original YAML files where targets were defined, even in split configurations
- **Build Actions**: Quick access buttons for build, clean, and rebuild operations
- **Terminal Integration**: Executes Catboy commands directly in the VS Code integrated terminal
- **Status Bar Integration**: Shows current target and build progress in the status bar
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and error reporting for build.yaml files
- **Command Palette**: Quick target selection and output viewing via command palette
- **Smart Terminal Management**: Reuses terminals per target for better organization
- **Automatic YPP Processing**: Intelligently processes YPP when YAML files change, with graceful fallback
- **Multilingual Support**: Complete English and Simplified Chinese translations with runtime language switching

## Requirements

- [Catboy build system](https://github.com/catboy-build/catboy) installed and available in your PATH
- Visual Studio Code 1.74.0 or higher

## Installation

1. Install the extension from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace
2. Ensure the `catboy` executable is available in your system PATH, or configure the executable path in settings

## Usage

### Opening the Catboy View

Click on the Catboy icon in the Activity Bar (left sidebar) to open the Catboy projects view.

### Project Structure

The extension recognizes projects defined in `build.yaml` files with the following structure:

```yaml
name: my-project

targets:
  my-target:
    build:
      type: executable
      sources:
        c:
          - src/main.c
          - src/*.c
      includes:
        - include
      defines:
        - DEBUG=1
      links:
        - pthread
      flags:
        c: -Wall -Wextra -g
```

### YPP (YAML Pre-processor) Support

The extension fully supports Catboy's YPP module for split YAML configurations. You can use `$include` directives to organize your build configurations across multiple files:

```yaml
name: my-project

# Include platform configurations
platforms:
  $include: platforms/*.yaml

targets:
  # Pattern 1: Full target definition (no includes)
  simple-app:
    build:
      type: executable
      sources:
        c: ["src/main.c"]
  
  # Pattern 2: Target with build content included
  complex-app:
    build:
      type: executable
      $include: configs/complex-build.yaml
      sources:
        c: ["src/main.c", "src/utils.c"]
  
  # Pattern 3: Whole targets included from separate files
  $include: targets/library-targets.yaml
```

The extension automatically runs `catboy ypp` to process includes and uses the generated metadata for precise navigation to original source files.

### Interactive CodeLens for $include Directives

The extension provides interactive CodeLens features for `$include` directives in YAML files:

- **Clickable Links**: Links appear above each `$include` line (similar to Git merge editor)
- **Smart Resolution**: Single files open directly; multiple files show selection menu
- **Visual Feedback**: File paths have underline decorations and hover tooltips
- **F12 Navigation**: Use "Go to Definition" (F12) on include paths for quick navigation
- **Error Handling**: Missing files display "‚ö†Ô∏è File not found" with appropriate styling
- **Multilingual**: All text adapts to your language setting (English/‰∏≠ÊñáÁÆÄ‰Ωì)

Example CodeLens display:
- Single file: "üìÑ Open YAML File" / "üìÑ ÊâìÂºÄ YAML Êñá‰ª∂"
- Multiple files: "üìÅ 3 files (click to choose)" / "üìÅ 3 ‰∏™Êñá‰ª∂ÔºàÁÇπÂáªÈÄâÊã©Ôºâ"
- Missing file: "‚ö†Ô∏è File not found" / "‚ö†Ô∏è Êñá‰ª∂Êú™ÊâæÂà∞"

### Available Actions

Each target in the tree view provides three action buttons:

- **Build** (‚öôÔ∏è): Executes `catboy build -v -f <yaml-file>`
- **Clean** (üóëÔ∏è): Executes `catboy clean -v -f <yaml-file>`
- **Rebuild** (üîÑ): Executes `catboy rebuild -v -f <yaml-file>`

### Additional Features

- **Status Bar**: Shows the currently selected target and build progress
- **Command Palette**: Access `Catboy: Select Target` and `Catboy: Show Output` commands
- **Output Channel**: View detailed logs and error messages in the "Catboy" output channel
- **Auto-refresh**: Automatically detects changes to build.yaml files and refreshes the view

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `catboy.executablePath`: Path to the Catboy executable. If not specified, the extension will use `catboy` from PATH.
* `catboy.showYamlFiles`: Show build.yaml file entries in the project tree view (default: false). Can also be toggled via the button in the tree view header.
* `catboy.verboseBuild`: Enable verbose build output by including the `-v` flag in catboy commands (default: true).
* `catboy.language`: Override the extension language display (default: auto). Supports English and Simplified Chinese (zh-hans).
