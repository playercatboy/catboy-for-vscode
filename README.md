- **Smart Terminal Management**: Reuses terminals per target for better organization

## Requirements

- [Catboy build system](https://github.com/catboy-build/catboy) installed and available in your PATH
- Visual Studio Code 1.74.0 or higher

## Installation

1. Install the extension from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace
2. Ensure the `catboy` executable is available in your system PATH, or configure the executable path in settings

## Usage

### Opening the Catboy View

Click on the Catboy icon in the Activity Bar (left sidebar) to open the Catboy projects view.

### Project Structure

The extension recognizes projects defined in `build.yaml` files with the following structure:

```yaml
name: my-project

targets:
  my-target:
    build:
      type: executable
      sources:
        c:
          - src/main.c
          - src/*.c
      includes:
        - include
      defines:
        - DEBUG=1
      links:
        - pthread
      flags:
        c: -Wall -Wextra -g
```

### Available Actions

Each target in the tree view provides three action buttons:

- **Build** (‚öôÔ∏è): Executes `catboy build -v -f <yaml-file>`
- **Clean** (üóëÔ∏è): Executes `catboy clean -v -f <yaml-file>`
- **Rebuild** (üîÑ): Executes `catboy rebuild -v -f <yaml-file>`

### Additional Features

- **Status Bar**: Shows the currently selected target and build progress
- **Command Palette**: Access `Catboy: Select Target` and `Catboy: Show Output` commands
- **Output Channel**: View detailed logs and error messages in the "Catboy" output channel
- **Auto-refresh**: Automatically detects changes to build.yaml files and refreshes the view

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `catboy.executablePath`: Path to the Catboy executable. If not specified, the extension will use `catboy` from PATH.
* `catboy.showYamlFiles`: Show build.yaml file entries in the project tree view (default: false). Can also be toggled via the button in the tree view header.
