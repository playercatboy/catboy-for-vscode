# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Visual Studio Code extension for the Catboy build system. The Catboy build system is a C build system that uses YAML files for build configuration.

**Important**: This extension provides build system integration only. It does NOT implement:
- Syntax highlighting (handled by VSCode's built-in YAML support and C/C++ extensions)
- IntelliSense or code completion (handled by Microsoft C/C++ or clangd extensions)
- It simply provides a GUI interface for build, clean, and rebuild operations

## Development Commands

### VSCode Extension Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile TypeScript
npm run compile

# Watch mode for development
npm run watch

# Run tests
npm test

# Package extension
vsce package

# Lint code
npm run lint
```

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Extension Activation**: The extension activates when a workspace contains `build.yaml` files that define Catboy projects.

2. **Project Discovery**: Scans workspace for `build.yaml` files and extracts:
   - Project name from the `name` property
   - Targets from the `targets` section
   - **YPP Integration**: Automatically processes YAML Pre-processor includes using `catboy ypp` command
   - **Original Source Tracking**: Uses flattened.json metadata for precise navigation to original YAML files

3. **UI Components**:
   - **Activity Bar Icon**: Custom "Catboy" icon in the VSCode activity bar
   - **Interactive CodeLens**: Clickable links above `$include` directives with full internationalization
   - **Tree View Provider**: Displays hierarchical view of projects and targets
   - **Action Buttons**: Build, Clean, and Rebuild buttons for each target
   - **Status Bar**: Shows current selected target and build progress
   - **Output Channel**: Detailed logging and error reporting

4. **Command Execution**: Integrates with VSCode terminal to execute Catboy CLI commands:
   - Build: `catboy build [-v] -f <yaml-file>` (verbose flag configurable via `catboy.verboseBuild` setting)
   - Clean: `catboy clean [-v] -f <yaml-file>` (verbose flag configurable via `catboy.verboseBuild` setting)
   - Rebuild: `catboy rebuild [-v] -f <yaml-file>` (verbose flag configurable via `catboy.verboseBuild` setting)

5. **Enhanced Features**:
   - **YPP Support**: Complete YAML Pre-processor integration for split YAML configurations using `$include` directives
   - **Enhanced Navigation**: Go-to-file functionality navigates to original YAML files where targets were defined
   - **Automatic YPP Processing**: Intelligent YPP processing with file watching and graceful fallback
   - **Internationalization**: Comprehensive Simplified Chinese (zh-hans) support with runtime language switching
   - **Error Handling**: Comprehensive YAML validation with user-friendly error messages
   - **Terminal Management**: Smart reuse of terminals per target
   - **Command Palette**: Quick target selection via "Catboy: Select Target"
   - **File Watching**: Auto-refresh on build.yaml changes with YPP re-processing
   - **Language Override**: Custom language selection independent of VS Code system settings

### Key Implementation Areas

- **src/extension.ts**: Extension entry point and activation logic with CodeLens provider registration
- **src/treeDataProvider.ts**: Tree view implementation for project/target display
- **src/projectDiscovery.ts**: Logic for finding and parsing build.yaml files with comprehensive error handling and YPP integration
- **src/commands.ts**: Command handlers for build/clean/rebuild operations with status integration and configurable verbose flag
- **src/statusBar.ts**: Status bar integration showing current target and build progress
- **src/terminalManager.ts**: Smart terminal management with reuse per target
- **src/yamlParser.ts**: Custom lightweight YAML parser for build.yaml files (zero dependencies)
- **src/languageManager.ts**: Custom internationalization system with runtime language switching and placeholder replacement
- **src/includeProvider.ts**: CodeLens, hover, and definition providers for `$include` directives with full i18n support

### Extension Configuration

The extension provides the following configuration settings:
- `catboy.executablePath`: Path to the Catboy executable (default: uses `catboy` from PATH)
- `catboy.showYamlFiles`: Show build.yaml file entries in project tree view (default: false)
- `catboy.verboseBuild`: Enable verbose build output with `-v` flag (default: true)
- `catboy.language`: Override extension language, supports "auto", "en", "zh-hans" (default: auto)

## Build Configuration Format

Catboy uses YAML files with the following structure:
```yaml
name: project-name
targets:
  target-name:
    build:
      type: executable
      sources:
        c: [source files]
      includes: [include paths]
      defines: [macro definitions]
      links: [libraries]
      flags:
        c: compiler flags
```

### YPP (YAML Pre-processor) Support

The extension fully supports split YAML configurations using `$include` directives:

```yaml
name: project-name

# Include platform configurations
platforms:
  $include: platforms/*.yaml

targets:
  # Pattern 1: Full target (no includes)
  simple-target:
    build:
      type: executable
      sources: ["src/main.c"]
  
  # Pattern 2: Target with build content included
  complex-target:
    build:
      type: executable
      $include: configs/complex-build.yaml
      sources: ["src/main.c"]
  
  # Pattern 3: Whole targets included
  $include: targets/library-targets.yaml
```

The extension automatically:
- Runs `catboy ypp -f build.yaml` to process includes
- Uses `build/flattened.json` metadata for target discovery
- Provides precise navigation to original YAML files
- Falls back to direct parsing if YPP is unavailable

## Testing

### Development Testing
Press **F5** to launch Extension Development Host and test with the sample projects in `sample/` folder:
- Basic projects: `app-project/`, `lib-project/`, `kernel-project/`
- **YPP test project**: `ypp-test-project/` - demonstrates all three YPP include patterns

### Mock Testing
Use `sample/mock-catboy.bat` (Windows) or `sample/mock-catboy.sh` (Unix) as executable path for testing without installing Catboy.

### Automated Testing
Run `npm test` for the complete test suite.
