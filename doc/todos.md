# Development TODOs for Catboy VSCode Extension

## Overview
This extension serves as a build system integration for Catboy, providing a GUI interface for build operations.
It does NOT provide syntax highlighting or IntelliSense - those are handled by VSCode's built-in YAML support and C/C++ extensions.

## ✅ COMPLETED - Core Implementation Complete!

The VSCode extension for Catboy has been fully implemented with all major features working. This document now serves as a historical record of the development process.
